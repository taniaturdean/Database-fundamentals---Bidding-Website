# database-fundamentals
- php folder:
  - index.php contains the new user sheet where a person can sign up and their details are recorded into the database.
  - handle-form.php processes the form submitted from index.php, it checks that the details input are valid (e.g. no numbers in name) then opens a connection with the database, inserts the data.
  - functions.php does something important perhaps protecting from an html insertion attack, I'm not quite sure.

- starter folder:
  - it doesn't include the js and css folders so just make sure you have that locally
